This checklist is designed to get a security team from zero to their first documented hunt in one sprint. Repeat this cycle. Build the library.

## Pre-Hunt: Setup

- [ ] Define your **hypothesis** — make it specific and testable
- [ ] Identify the **MITRE ATT&CK tactic/technique** you're hunting
- [ ] Document your **data sources** (which logs, which SIEM, what retention window)
- [ ] Define your **scope** (which assets, environments, time window)
- [ ] Confirm **data availability** — run a quick validation query first

> **Rule:** If you can't write down your hypothesis in one sentence, you're not ready to start.

---

## During Hunt: Execution

- [ ] Start with a **baseline query** to understand normal behavior
- [ ] Profile volume, frequency, and statistical outliers
- [ ] Pivot on interesting artifacts (process names, hashes, IPs, user accounts)
- [ ] Document **every query** you run — copy/paste into a running log
- [ ] Note **dead ends** — negative findings are valid and reusable
- [ ] Tag anything suspicious for triage: host, timestamp, artifact

---

## Post-Hunt: Documentation

- [ ] Write the **hunt report** (Hypothesis → Scope → Queries → Findings)
- [ ] Classify findings: True Positive / False Positive / Inconclusive
- [ ] If True Positive: escalate per IR procedures
- [ ] Convert best query into a **detection rule** (Sigma, KQL, SPL)
- [ ] Submit detection rule to your SIEM rule library
- [ ] Schedule the hunt for re-execution (monthly or on threat intel trigger)

## Tooling Baseline

You need at minimum:
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| SIEM (Splunk/Sentinel/Elastic) | Query execution, log search |
| EDR (CrowdStrike/Defender/SentinelOne) | Endpoint process/network telemetry |
| MITRE ATT&CK Navigator | Technique mapping and coverage tracking |
| Sigma | Vendor-agnostic detection rule format |
| Git repo | Hunt report version control |

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Hunting without a hypothesis** — aimless log searching ≠ threat hunting
2. **Not documenting queries** — you'll need to rerun them next month
3. **Stopping at "nothing found"** — document it as a negative; baseline it
4. **Skipping detection rule creation** — the hunt wasn't complete if you didn't codify what you learned
5. **No peer review** — always have a second set of eyes on true positives before escalation

## Template: Hunt Report Header

```markdown
# Hunt Report: [Title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Analyst:** [Name]  
**Tactic:** [MITRE Tactic]  
**Technique:** [T-Number — Name]  

## Hypothesis
If [condition], then [indicator] will appear in [data source].

## Scope
- Data source: [SIEM + log type]
- Timeframe: [start] to [end]
- Asset coverage: [environment description]

## Queries
[SPL/KQL/query here]

## Findings
[Description or "No indicators observed"]

## Detection Output
[Sigma rule or "No rule created — negative hunt"]
```
