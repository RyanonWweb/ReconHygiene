## What Changed in CSF 2.0

NIST CSF 2.0 (released February 2024) introduced significant updates from version 1.1:

1. **New "GOVERN" function** — Elevated organizational governance to a first-class function
2. **Expanded audience** — Now explicitly addresses all organizations, not just critical infrastructure
3. **Supply chain risk** — Integrated throughout as a cross-cutting concern
4. **Profiles and Tiers** — Refined guidance on implementation target states

## The Six Functions

| Function | Purpose | Key Question |
|---|---|---|
| **GOVERN** | Set strategy, roles, accountability | Who owns security decisions? |
| **IDENTIFY** | Understand your assets and risks | What do we have and what's at risk? |
| **PROTECT** | Implement safeguards | How do we prevent incidents? |
| **DETECT** | Find events fast | How do we know something is happening? |
| **RESPOND** | Act when events occur | What do we do when we detect it? |
| **RECOVER** | Restore and learn | How do we get back to normal? |

## GOVERN (New in 2.0)

The GOVERN function establishes the organizational context for cybersecurity risk management. Key categories:

- **GV.OC** — Organizational Context
- **GV.RM** — Risk Management Strategy
- **GV.RR** — Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities
- **GV.PO** — Policy
- **GV.OV** — Oversight
- **GV.SC** — Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management

### Practitioner Note
GOVERN is where policy meets practice. In federal environments, this maps directly to the **RMF Step 2 (Categorize)** and the **System Security Plan (SSP)** governance sections. For 2210/ISSO candidates, demonstrating GOVERN awareness is increasingly expected in interviews.

## IDENTIFY

Key sub-functions:
- **ID.AM** — Asset Management
- **ID.RA** — Risk Assessment
- **ID.SC** — Supply Chain Risk Management

**Detection Engineering angle:** Without solid ID.AM, you can't scope a threat hunt. Knowing what systems are in scope, what OS versions exist, and what data flows between them is foundational.

---

## DETECT

The most operationally relevant function for threat hunters and SOC analysts:

- **DE.AE** — Adverse Event Analysis
- **DE.CM** — Continuous Monitoring

### Control examples:
```
DE.CM-01: Networks and network services are monitored
DE.CM-03: Personnel activity and technology usage are monitored
DE.CM-06: External service provider activities are monitored
```

These map directly to SIEM coverage requirements. When scoping a threat hunt program, trace your data sources back to DE.CM controls to demonstrate coverage depth.

## Mapping to RMF

| RMF Step | CSF Function | Key Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Prepare | GOVERN, IDENTIFY | Risk management strategy |
| 2. Categorize | IDENTIFY | System categorization (FIPS 199) |
| 3. Select | PROTECT, DETECT | Control selection |
| 4. Implement | PROTECT | Control implementation evidence |
| 5. Assess | All | Security assessment report (SAR) |
| 6. Authorize | GOVERN | ATO decision |
| 7. Monitor | DETECT, RESPOND | ConMon reports |

## Interview Prep Notes

Common ISSO/2210 interview questions related to CSF:

1. "Walk me through how you'd use CSF 2.0 to prioritize security investments at a new agency."
2. "What's the difference between a CSF Profile and a Tier?"
3. "How does CSF 2.0 align with NIST SP 800-53?"

**Quick answers:**
- **Profile** = your current state vs target state, documented by function/category
- **Tier** = how rigorous your risk management practice is (1=Partial → 4=Adaptive)
- **SP 800-53** = the control catalog; CSF = the framework. CSF categories map to 800-53 controls via the NIST online mapping tool.
